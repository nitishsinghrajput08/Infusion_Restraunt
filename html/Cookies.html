            OUR COLLECTION AND USE OF OTHER INFORMATION
            Like many other websites, our Site may use "Cookies" or "Other Technologies" (such as "pixel tags," "web
            beacons,"
            "clear GIFs", links in emails, JavaScript, device IDs assigned by Google or Apple, or similar technologies).
            Cookies
            and Other Technologies allow us and third parties to obtain information about your visits to the Site,
            including to
            analyze your visiting patterns. We use this information to process your reservations or requests and to
            deliver
            online and mobile advertisements, messages and content for us and others that are specific to your
            interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device ("device") when you visit a
            website.
            Cookies alone cannot be used to disclose your individual identity to us, though in some cases we may tie
            Hilton or
            third-party Cookies to personal information you have provided to us or that we have otherwise obtained about
            you.
            Cookies may be used on the Site in order to improve your experience. For example we will use Cookies to:
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember your user name and password for future visits so that log-in is easier and faster;
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember your language and other preferences;
        </p>
        <p>
            Ensure you obtain all requested information;
        </p>
        <p>
            Provide a safe and secure service for online transactions;
        </p>
        <p>
            Track your response to advertisements and website or app content for analysis and the number of times we
            send you
            the same advertisement;
        </p>
        <p>
            Measure how many people use the Site, and how they use it, so that we may keep it running quickly and
            efficiently;
            and
        </p>
        <p>
            Help us and others deliver communications and content to you that are relevant and responsive to your
            interests and
            location.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below we explain the different types of Cookies that may be used on the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Essential Cookies - Essential Cookies are necessary for the Site to work, and enable you to move around it
            and use
            its services and features. Disabling these Cookies may make the services and features unavailable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Functional Cookies - We use Functional Cookies to save your settings on the Site—settings such as your
            language
            preference, or booking information you have previously used when booking a hotel with us. We also use
            Functional
            Cookies to store such things as the last hotel you searched for, so that you can easily find it the next
            time you
            visit. Some Functional Cookies are essential to viewing maps or videos on our Site. We also use "Flash
            Cookies" for
            some of our animated content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Session Cookies - These types of Cookies are stored only temporarily during a browsing session, and are
            deleted from
            your device when you close the browser. We use Session Cookies to support the functionality of the Site and
            to
            understand your use of the Site—that is, which pages you visit, which links you use and how long you stay on
            each
            page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Persistent Cookies - These types of Cookies are not deleted when you close your browser, but are saved on
            your
            device for a fixed period of time or until you delete them. Each time you visit the Site, the server that
            set the
            Cookie will recognize the persistent Cookie saved on your device. We and others use persistent Cookies to
            store your
            preferences, so that they are available for your next visit, to keep a more accurate account of how often
            you visit
            the Site, how often you return, how your use of the Site may vary over time and the effectiveness of
            advertising
            efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Advertising cookies - allow us and other advertisers to show you the most relevant products, offers, and
            advertisements on the Site and third-party sites, or through emails or other message platforms. For example,
            some
            Advertising Cookies help our service providers and other advertisers select advertisements that are based on
            your
            interests, including those expressed or inferred by visits to our websites or apps or across other websites,
            online
            services, and apps over time. Others help prevent the same advertisement from continuously reappearing for
            you.
            These types of Cookies also help us provide you with content on the Site that is tailored to your interests
            and
            needs. As noted below, some Analytics Cookies and Other Technologies are used in part to facilitate
            advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
            Social plugin cookies - Advertising Cookies also include Social Plug-In Cookies. Social Plug-In Cookies are
            used to
            share content from the Site with members and non-members of social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter,
            YouTube
            and Pinterest. These Cookies are usually set by the social networking provider, enabling such sharing to be
            smooth
            and seamless.
        </p>
        <p>
            Analytics cookies - collect information about your use of the Site, and enable us to improve the way it
            works. These
            Cookies give us aggregated information that we use to monitor site performance, count page visits, spot
            technical
            errors, see how users reach the Site, and measure the effectiveness of advertising (including emails we send
            to
            you).
        </p>
        <p>
            Other technologies may be used for the same purposes as our Cookies, to allow us and third parties to know
            when you
            visit the Site, and to understand how you interact with emails or advertisements. Through Other
            Technologies,
            non-personal information (e.g., your operating system, your browser version, and the URL you came from) or
            aggregate
            information may be obtained and used to enhance your experience and understand traffic patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that, to the extent that information collected through Cookies and Other Technologies constitutes
            personal
            information, the provisions in the Global Privacy Statement apply and complement this Statement. Please note
            that at
            this time we do not honor Do Not Track and similar signals.
        </p>
        <p>
            ONLINE AND MOBILE ADVERTISING; MOBILE APPS
        </p>
        <p>
            We and third parties engage in interest-based advertising provided by vendors in order to deliver
            advertisements and
            personalized content that we and other advertisers believe will be of interest to you. To the extent
            third-parties
            are using Cookies or Other Technologies to perform these services, Hilton does not control the use of this
            technology or the resulting information for online, mobile, or email advertising, and is not responsible for
            any
            actions or policies of such third parties. Advertisements, emails, and other messages may be delivered to
            you by
            Hilton or its service providers based on your online or mobile behavior (on Hilton and non-Hilton sites),
            your
            search activity, your geographic location or other information that is collected by us or obtained from
            third
            parties. For example, if you go to the Site to book a hotel room, you may later see an advertisement from us
            when
            you visit another website. These advertisements may appear on our sites, third-party websites or on mobile
            platforms. You may also see advertisements for third parties on the Site, other websites or properties, or
            on your
            mobile device, based on your visits to, and activities on, the Site, other sites and our apps and
            third-party apps.
            Some of our vendors and we may use our own or third-party aggregated or anonymized personal information,
            demographic
            data, and other inferred commercial interests to assist in the delivery of our advertisements to you. As
            stated in
            our Global Privacy Statement, in some instances we may combine Other Information with personal information.
            If we do
            combine any Other Information with personal information, the provisions in the Global Privacy Statement
            apply and
            complement this Statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            We comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral
            Advertising
            and related DAA Principles and Guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
            CROSS-DEVICE TECHNOLOGIES
        </p>
        <p>
            We and our business partners use third parties to establish deterministic or probabilistic connections among
            devices
            (such as smartphones, tablets, and computers) to deliver more relevant advertising to you and for
            advertising
            analytics and reporting purposes. This means that information about your use of websites or applications on
            your
            current device may be combined with information from your other devices. We also may share this information
            and
            other inferences with third parties to allow them to target advertising, personalize content, or analyze
            behavior.
            This allows, for example, advertisements you see on your tablet to be based on activities you engaged in on
            your
            smartphone.
        </p>
        <p>
            These business partners may share and combine information from cookies with identifiers (such as device IDs
            assigned
            by Google or Apple) and IP addresses to make connections among related devices. This also allows for a more
            personalized experience across our services and applications. For example, Hilton may through its vendors
            match your
            devices if you log into Hilton Honors on multiple devices or web browsers, or if your devices share similar
            attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household.
        </p>
        <p>
            To opt out of our cross-device linking vendors, go to www.aboutadvertisements.info/choices and perform a
            global
            opt-out on each browser and device that you would like to be opted out on. Opt out means that the browser on
            the
            device from which you opt out will no longer receive interest-based advertisements from information
            collected on
            devices linked to it, that devices linked to it will not receive interest-based advertisements based on
            information
            collected from the opted-out device, and that the vendor will not transfer data collected from the opted-out
            device
            to a third party. If, in the future, we work with cross-device vendors who have a proprietary opt-out, and
            for whom
            the DAA opt-out is not effective as described above, we will provide a link to those vendors’ proprietary
            opt-outs.
        </p>
